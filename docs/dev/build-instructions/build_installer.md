# Creating an installer

Currently, the installer creation has been tested on Windows only.

For creating the installer, [WixSharp](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp) has to be present on your system.

1. Download the [latest WixSharp release](https://github.com/oleg-shilo/wixsharp/releases)
2. Extract into a folder
3. Add that folder to the PATH environment variable

When creating an installer, you _have to_ specify a build number using e.g. `-DBUILD_NUMBER=3` when invoking cmake. The build number is used to
differentiate multiple builds for the same Mumble version and feeds the default Windows installer compatibility version
`MUMBLE_WINDOWS_INSTALLER_VERSION`, which defaults to `1.0.build`. That keeps the fork install easy to replace with official Mumble later
while still letting newer fork installers replace older installs in place. If you are creating an installer for yourself, just use build number `0`.

The cmake option `packaging`, off by default, specifies whether or not to build the installer. If being built it will be multi-lingual by default. 

Use the cmake generate option `-Dpackaging=ON` to enable building the installer.

Use the additional cmake generate option `-Dtranslations=OFF` to build a single-language installer instead.

If you intentionally need a different Windows installer upgrade relationship, override the compatibility version explicitly:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -Dpackaging=ON -DBUILD_NUMBER=3 -DMUMBLE_WINDOWS_INSTALLER_VERSION=1.0.3
```

The Windows client installer can also be built from a staged payload root. In that mode it packages the files present in the stage and only adds optional feature payloads, such as overlay or screen-share helper binaries, when the build produced them.
