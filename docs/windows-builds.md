# Windows Client Builds

This fork uses two GitHub workflow paths for Windows client coverage:

- Workflow: `CI`
- File: [ci.yml](../.github/workflows/ci.yml)
- Trigger: push, pull request, and manual dispatch
- Static Windows runner: `windows-2025-vs2026`
- Purpose: required PR/build validation for the static Windows client/server lane

The heavier shared/WebEngine client lane is kept separate:

- Workflow: `Windows Shared Client Installer`
- File: [windows-shared-client.yml](../.github/workflows/windows-shared-client.yml)
- Trigger: push to `master`, pull request to `master`, and manual dispatch
- Shared Windows runner: `windows-2022`
- Output: unsigned shared/WebEngine client payload and installer artifacts

The reusable shared/WebEngine dependency archive has its own manual workflow:

- Workflow: `Windows Shared Build Environment`
- File: [windows-shared-build-environment.yml](../.github/workflows/windows-shared-build-environment.yml)
- Trigger: manual dispatch
- Shared Windows runner: `windows-2022`
- Output: the `build-env-2025-11-webengine-codecs` release asset consumed by
  the normal shared/WebEngine client workflows

There is also a small human-facing installer workflow for this fork:

- Workflow: `mumble-forked MSI Release`
- File: [mumble-forked.yml](../.github/workflows/mumble-forked.yml)
- Trigger: manual dispatch from `master`
- Shared Windows runner: `windows-2022`
- Output: the latest unsigned shared/WebEngine client MSI attached to the stable
  `mumble-forked` GitHub Release

## Recommended use

- Use `CI` for the normal pull-request gate and static Windows artifact validation.
- Use `Windows Shared Client Installer` when you need the shared/WebEngine payload
  under `build-shared-webengine\shared-webengine-stage` or downloadable Windows
  shared client artifacts.
- Use `Windows Shared Build Environment` only when the pinned shared/WebEngine
  dependency archive itself needs to be rebuilt and republished.
- Use `mumble-forked MSI Release` when you want a simple stable download link
  for this fork. It uses the shared/WebEngine lane so the installer includes
  the current Modern/WebEngine functionality, then publishes the MSI to a normal
  GitHub Release instead of a short-lived Actions artifact.

## How to run the shared client workflow

1. Push your branch to GitHub.
2. Open `Actions` in the fork.
3. Select `Windows Shared Client Installer`.
4. Click `Run workflow` on the branch you want to build.
5. Download the uploaded artifact from the completed run.

## How to publish mumble-forked

1. Merge the intended code to `master`.
2. Open `Actions` in the fork.
3. Select `mumble-forked MSI Release`.
4. Enter a short `update_announcement`. This is the user-facing sentence shown
   in the in-app update notification, so write it before publishing instead of
   relying on the generic build metadata.
5. Optionally enter `release_notes` for extra hand-written detail. The workflow
   also generates a changelog automatically from the previous published
   `mumble-forked` commit to the new `master` commit.
6. Click `Run workflow` on `master`.
7. Use the stable release page:
   `https://github.com/dankmaster/mumble/releases/tag/mumble-forked`.

The workflow builds the shared/WebEngine Windows client with packaging enabled,
deletes older `mumble-forked` / `mumble-forked-*` releases and tags, then
recreates the stable `mumble-forked` tag and release from the current `master`
commit. It explicitly preserves `build-env-*` releases, including the important
`build-env-2025-11-webengine-codecs` release used by the shared Windows build
environment.

The `Release Publishing` workflow ignores `mumble-forked*` and `build-env-*`
tags so this convenience MSI does not dispatch Docker publishing or WinGet
updates.

The workflow writes the announcement, optional release notes, generated
changelog, current commit, previous published commit, installer URL, and SHA256
into `mumble-forked-update.json`. Modern clients use that checksum for the
in-app update flow: startup checks show an update toast, the Update action
downloads and verifies the MSI in the background, and the ready toast launches
Windows Installer when the user restarts to update. Mumble closes before the
MSI runs, hands the transition to `mumble-updater.exe`, and starts itself again
after a successful passive install. Before handing off to the updater, the
client writes a one-shot resume snapshot so the reopened client can return to
the same server, voice room, chat view, and saved window layout where possible.
It also uploads `changelog.md` beside the
MSI and prints an update-notification preview during the run. Local development
builds use build number `0`, so automatic startup checks skip the public updater
by default. To preview a draft manifest locally, set
`MUMBLE_FORK_UPDATE_MANIFEST_URL` to a local
`file:///.../mumble-forked-update.json` URL and set
`MUMBLE_FORK_FORCE_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION=1` before launching the dev client.

## Notes

- `CI` keeps Windows tests disabled and validates the Windows build through
  binary, installer, payload, and screen-share helper artifact checks.
- `CI` keeps the static Linux server artifact lane separate from a shared Linux
  server-focused `ctest` lane, so pull requests have one practical test gate
  without making the Windows lane slower.
- The shared/WebEngine workflow skips installer generation on pull requests, but
  still stages and validates the shared payload.
- The shared/WebEngine workflow verifies the screen-share helper runtime only
  for manual dispatch runs; normal PR helper runtime coverage lives in `CI`.
- The shared/WebEngine workflow pins the reusable codec environment to release
  `2025-11`, commit `127cccc01d`, suffix `webengine-codecs-v1`, and ONNX
  Runtime `1.18.1`.
- The shared/WebEngine workflow looks for
  `mumble_env.x64-windows.<commit>.webengine-codecs-v1.7z` or split
  `mumble_env.x64-windows.<commit>.webengine-codecs-v1.7z.001/.002/...` assets
  under this repo's `build-env-2025-11-webengine-codecs` GitHub release tag.
  Normal client/MSI workflows fail fast if that archive is missing instead of
  falling back to a slow local Qt/vcpkg bootstrap path.
- Use the manual `Windows Shared Build Environment` workflow, or the local
  publisher command below, when the codec environment needs to be rebuilt. This
  is the one intentionally heavy path; the normal build workflows consume the
  published archive or the matching cache key.
- `mumble-forked` releases are unsigned convenience builds for this fork.
  Windows SmartScreen can warn on these installers until a real signing flow is
  added.

## Local Windows build

If you want to build unsigned Windows client artifacts on your own PC instead
of GitHub Actions, use:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\build-local-windows-client.ps1 -InstallDependencies
```

Optional runtime verification of the screen-share helper:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\build-local-windows-client.ps1 `
  -InstallDependencies `
  -InstallFfmpeg `
  -VerifyHelperRuntime
```

If you only need a fast local client build and want to skip the experimental
screen-share helper target, pass an extra CMake option:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\build-local-windows-client.ps1 `
  -AdditionalCMakeOptions -Dscreen-helper=OFF
```

If Windows still has a pending reboot marker from servicing and you
intentionally want to continue anyway, the local build script also accepts:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\windows\build-local-windows-client.ps1 `
  -AllowPendingReboot
```

Notes for local use:

- Install Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ build tools before running the script.
- Install Git for Windows. The script prefers Git Bash and auto-detects Visual
  Studio's bundled `cmake` and `ninja`, so they do not need to be added to
  `PATH` manually.
- The local build script auto-detects `ONNXRUNTIME_ROOT` from the newest
  `.tmp\onnxruntime-win-x64-*` directory when present, which enables the DTLN
  backend in local Windows client builds without extra manual flags.
- If Rust was installed with `rustup`, the script prepends
  `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` to `PATH` so DeepFilterNet can build its runtime
  DLL from the vendored `libDF` C API. Without `cargo` or a packaged
  `deepfilter.dll`, DeepFilterNet is left disabled while the rest of the client
  still builds.
- `-InstallFfmpeg` downloads a portable Windows `ffmpeg` bundle into
  `build_tools\ffmpeg` and prepends it to `PATH` for the current run. It does
  not require Chocolatey or an administrator shell.
- The local build script skips MSI packaging by default for a faster local test
  loop. Pass `-EnablePackaging` only if you need installers and already have
  WiX available.
- Windows installers use a deliberately low compatibility version by default
  (`1.0.<build number>`) so stock Mumble installers can replace fork installs
  in place.
- Override the compatibility version only if you explicitly need a different
  upgrade relationship: `-DMUMBLE_WINDOWS_INSTALLER_VERSION=<version>`.
- The script mirrors the shared workflow's configure/build path when
  `-SharedWebEngine` is used.
- The shared workflow bootstraps the pinned ONNX Runtime archive for DTLN and
  installs Rust so the DeepFilterNet runtime DLL can be built on the Windows
  runner as part of the client artifact build.
- `-AllowPendingReboot` is an opt-in escape hatch for local use: it downgrades
  hard pending-reboot blockers to warnings for that run instead of aborting.
- It skips local MySQL setup because that workflow has tests disabled.
- Static lane artifacts are written into `build\`; shared/WebEngine artifacts
  are written into `build-shared-webengine\`.

## Publishing a reusable Windows build environment

If you already have a populated local Windows build environment under
`build_env\`, you can package and publish the exact `.7z` archive that the
shared Windows CI lane expects:

```powershell
.\scripts\windows\publish-windows-build-environment.ps1 `
  -EnvironmentRelease 2025-11 `
  -EnvironmentCommit 127cccc01d `
  -EnvironmentVersionSuffix webengine-codecs-v1 `
  -BuildType shared `
  -ReleaseTag build-env-2025-11-webengine-codecs `
  -Upload `
  -CreateRelease
```

Notes:

- For shared/WebEngine environments, the script refuses to publish unless
  `webengine_webchannel` and `webengine_proprietary_codecs` are enabled in the
  Qt WebEngine target metadata.
- By default the script creates split
  `mumble_env.x64-windows.<commit>.<suffix>.7z.001` style volumes under
  `.tmp\build-env-archives\` using a `1900m` size cap, so the assets fit under
  GitHub's per-release-asset upload limit.
- By default it publishes to the GitHub repo from your `origin` remote and
  uses the release tag `build-env-<release>`.
- Pass `-Repository <owner>/<repo>` and optionally `-ReleaseTag <tag>` if you
  want to publish to a sister repo instead of this one.
- It uploads only when `-Upload` is passed. Without that flag it just creates
  the local archive so you can inspect it first.
- If the release already exists and you want to replace the asset, rerun with
  `-Clobber`.
- The script requires a 7-Zip-compatible CLI (`7z.exe` or `7za.exe`) and
  `gh.exe` for uploads.
